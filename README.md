### Welcome to my Github Profile!

My name is Robert Mancuso, I am a former Army Officer and West Point graduate transitioning into the world of coding after 8 years of military service.

- I recently completed a full-stack web development bootcamp through the University of Texas, Austin
- I am currently interested in beginning a career in web development, software engineering, or data analysis (although my interests extend well beyond these fields!)
- I am based out of Dripping Springs, TX (right outside Austin!)
- I served as an Infantry Officer in the Army during my time in service, although I also held roles in training, recruiting, and marketing/public affairs
